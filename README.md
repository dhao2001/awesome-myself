# Awesome Myself

## Introduction

> Less hesitate. More create!

This is my repository which stores some scripts and tips I found or summarized.

The reason I created this repository is that, we have wasted too much time on the things that are not so **creative**, e.g., struggling with the environment.

Yes, there are search engines, there are `*****overflow`, there are so many blogs on the internet. But sometime you might find it difficult to search for a solution.

It is true that I can share these tips and scripts on my blog. That is what I have done in the past. However, seting up a blog takes time too!

Think about it: you have to choose which blog framework to use. Is it static or dynamic? Will it be hosted on your server or something else? Should I buy a domian name or just use the `*.github.io`?

What's more, there are chances that we are addicted to a delicate theme, or stuck with a funny web control, playing with an extension, and so on.

Today we have more and more choices, but we are not always making the right choice. 

Of course, these things are interesting, but unfortunately, they are **only one** of the steps we take in making something awesome. Our time is limited; tracking our goals makes sense.

So instead of setting up another blog again, I just want to store my scripts and tips in this repository to make myself awesome. 

## Contribution

Correction and improvement are welcome!

However, these scripts might not always be the *best practice* and they might be silly or complex. But they are the ways I used to deal with some specified problems. So if you find my content laughable, I would be happy if you could improve it. 

Or at least, we can all make ourselves awesome too.
